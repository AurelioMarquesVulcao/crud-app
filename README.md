## Temporario

I started the application by visiting the Inchurch website and application and studied the UX / UI design and technologies used to model the methodology of my development.

After this phase, I inspected the site for favicon and Inchurch logo.

I created a CRUD for mobile App using Iphone X as base screen format.
On the first screen, you will find the home prototype with:
*Login
Username: @inchurch, password: God2020
In the second screen, it is displayed in orderly list, the users provided by the API and through a button the details are displayed.

Na última tela do API encontra-se as funções de: 
* Novo Usuário
* Atualizar Usuário 
* Excluir Usuário

Below are the functions and expected responses from the server.

I applied Agile Methodology in order to equalize the demands and thus create a favorable scenario for creation and development.

I appreciate the opportunity to participate in the selection process.
Thank you Inchurch Team
